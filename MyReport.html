<h1>Des & Dev Class
</h1>

<h1>Goal: Redesign a website
</h1>

<h1>Plan: Evaluate the site and propose changes if needed.
</h1>

<p>Accomplishments:  
Viewed several pages of the website, Fairhaven Bible Chapel.
Talked to the person who oversees the website.
Learned that website was redesigned once.
Talked to a few of the users. This what I learned from talking to the users, was to
keep the website up to date. The users mainly looked for time and date about an event
or to find more information on the event. The users were 50 years and older.
  
  Results:

After some exploring and findings, I realinze that redesigning website should not be the goal, but
that I should have done the findings first to see if redesigning the website was necessary.



This is the website that I am using:
