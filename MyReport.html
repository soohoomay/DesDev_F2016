<h1>Des & Dev Class
</h1>

<h1>Goal: Redesign a website
</h1>

<h1>Plan: Evaluate the site and propose changes if needed.
</h1>

<p>Accomplishments:  Viewed several pages of the website, Fairhaven Bible Chapel.
Talked to the person who oversees the website.
Learned that website was redesigned once.
Talked to a few of the users. This what I learned from talking to the users was to
keep the website up to date. The users mainly looked for time and 
date about an event or to find more information on the event.

To do-answer these three points
User profiles-who are they
Task scenarios-what are the task they do with the website
Goal-how will you know the redesign will be successful



Study their wireframe.
Found some users. The users were of mid age users.
These users were familiar with site.

This is the website that I am using:
